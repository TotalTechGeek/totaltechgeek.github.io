Please explain the Gospel and how it has impacted your life.<br>
</b>
We live in a broken world, where our sin separates us from God and leads us to despair. It wasn't always this way, but man selfishly turned its back on God. 
<br>
But God, being benevolent and loving, had a plan to save us from our sin and selfishness, and sent his son to save us. 
<br>
Our sins are forgiven and our debt is paid (in full) through Christ.

<b>When did you become a follower of Jesus?</b>
<br>
I became a follower of Christ between the 6th and 7th Grade. My family did not attend Church because of household disputes. While I was extremely skeptical, I always felt a underlying strong desire to know God and begged my family to attend Church.
<br><br>
We joined First Baptist Mansfield, and there I heard the Gospel. We did not attend the church consistently for very long (only a year or two), but during that time I was baptized and continued to have enthusiasm for my faith. 
<br><br>
More recently, I've been able to start attending again.

How would you define what it means to be a successful student leader at BSM?
</b> 
<br>
While I don't think there's a specific "6-Step" path or anything to being a successful student leader at the BSM, I believe that a successful leader needs to be accessible and approachable. 
<br><br>
I believe that a successful student leader encourages fellowship and Biblical discussion between peers, and makes an effort to be available to those who need help or guidance.
<br><br>
I also believe that a successful student leader in the BSM should try to avoid behaviours that would hurt the reputation of their faith and the BSM. 
<br>

<b> Why are you applying for BSM Leadership? </b>
<br><br>
I wish to be used by the BSM to reach more students at UTA, and seek more opportunities to grow in my faith, and help others grow in theirs. <br<br>
While I will continue to try to help the BSM as much as I can even if I am discouraged from seeking a position, I wish to be more accessible to the BSM. 

<br><hr>

<b> How have you been involved in the BSM? </b> <br>
I've attended nearly every WideAwake since the first one in the Summer of 2016, and have tried to consistently attend Impact Training to learn more about sharing the Gospel with those who are lost. 
<br><br>
I've also tried to reach out to friends and acquaintances to encourage them to check out the BSM.

<b> What are your strengths in ministry, spiritual gifts, etc.? </b>
<br><br>
I am passionate about sharing the Gospel with others, and I am confident in doing so. I also love studying the history around the Bible (Old and New Testament). I believe that history strongly reinforces the Bible as truth, even among skeptics (it worked with me).  
<br><br>
When it comes to Spiritual Gifts, I believe in what is outlined by 1 Corinthians Chapters 12 &amp; 13.
